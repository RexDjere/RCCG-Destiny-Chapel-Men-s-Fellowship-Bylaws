### Section 03: Membership Dues

Each member of the Men's Fellowship will pay dues of $30 per month.  

The Men's Fellowship Executives will function on behalf of Men's Fellowship members in between meetings. During meetings, the Executives will make every effort to get concurrence from the members. The Executives, in coordination with the members, will create a budget to fund Men's Fellowship activities during each fiscal year.
